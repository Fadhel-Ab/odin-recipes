    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A grilled cheese sandwich is a classic comfort food made with melted cheese pressed between two slices of buttery, golden-brown toasted bread.
        <br> Crisp on the outside and gooey on the inside, it combines rich, savory flavors with a satisfying crunch, making it a timeless favorite for all ages.<br>
        Perfect on its own or paired with a warm bowl of soup!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bread (2 slices, any type you prefer, like white, whole wheat, or sourdough)</li>
        <li>Butter or margarine (for spreading on the bread)</li>
        <li>Cheese (1-2 slices or shredded, such as cheddar, mozzarella, or American cheese)</li>
        <h3>optional</h3>
            <li>Garlic powder or herbs (for extra flavor)</li>
            <li>Tomato slices, bacon, or ham (for a more filling sandwich)</li>
     </ul>

     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>Start by buttering one side of two slices of bread.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat, and place one slice, buttered side down, in the pan.</li>
        <li>Add a layer of your favorite cheese—cheddar, mozzarella, or a mix—and top with the second slice of bread, buttered side up.</li>
        <li>Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side until the bread is golden and crispy, and the cheese is melted. Serve hot and enjoy!  </li>
     </ol>
