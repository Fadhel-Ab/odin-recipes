    <h2>Steps </h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Prepare the beef patties:<br>
             Divide the ground beef into equal portions and shape them into round patties, slightly larger than the buns.<br>
         Press a small indentation in the center to prevent puffing during cooking.<br>
          Season both sides with salt and pepper.</p></li>
          <li><p>Cook the patties:<br>
             Heat a grill or skillet over medium-high heat.<br>
              Cook the patties for about 3-4 minutes per side for medium doneness, or adjust the time to your preference.<br>
               Add a slice of cheese on top during the last minute of cooking to let it melt.</p></li>
               <li><p>Toast the buns: Lightly butter the cut sides of the burger buns and toast them on the grill or in a skillet until golden.</p></li>
               <li><p>Assemble the burger:<br>
                 Start with the bottom bun, then layer it with lettuce, the cooked patty (with melted cheese, if using), tomato slices, onion slices, and pickles.<br>
                  Spread your favorite condiments on the top bun and place it over the toppings.</p></li>
    </ol>
