    <h2>Steps to Make a Pizza:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C) and place a pizza stone or baking sheet inside to heat up.</li>
        <li>Prepare the dough: Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness. Transfer the dough to a piece of parchment paper for easy handling.</li>
        <li>Add the sauce: Spread an even layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.</li>
        <li>Add the cheese: Sprinkle mozzarella cheese generously over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add toppings: Arrange your preferred toppings on the cheese, ensuring an even distribution.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza: Carefully slide the pizza (on the parchment paper) onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
        <li>Finish and serve: Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a couple of minutes. Garnish with fresh basil leaves or your favorite seasonings, slice, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
